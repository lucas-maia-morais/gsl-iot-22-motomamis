# ITA/TEC Motomamis IoT/Network Project
University exchange project between ITA and TEC students

## Objective
We're proposing one solution on the communication problem in flood catastrophes using drones (IoT) and Wifi communication to help rescue central identify isolated people.

## Motivation
This a project to help victims in natural disasters, where communication is off and the rescue process is hard to be made in the usual way. Our project is more focused on the flood natural disasters, but it can be easily adapted to other disasters as earthquakes.

To illustrate our point, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 2021 has released a report that **45% of all deaths in the world are related to natural disasters** in the last 50 years considering the period from 1970 to 2019. [Other important numbers are](https://brasil.un.org/pt-br/142679-desastres-naturais-foram-responsaveis-por-45-de-todas-mortes-nos-ultimos-50-anos-mostra-omm#:~:text=De%201970%20a%202019%2C%20os,trilh%C3%B5es%20de%20d%C3%B3lares%20em%20perdas):
- 11000 disasters are related to natural disasters
- 2 million deaths are natural disasters related
- 3.47 trillions of dollars were lost and today 383 millions are lost everyday in average
- And 91% of deaths occured in developing countries like Brazil and Mexico

Our idea here is to provide at least a help to improve these numbers by helping people and give humanitarian help by giving a solution to this technical problem proposed by our teachers from these [course](https://github.com/kabartsjc/gsl-iot-2022). And for a scenario exemplification please check the following video:
